<!--
    The canvas element is part of HTML5 and allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images.
    The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics on a web page.
    The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.
    The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.
    A canvas is a rectangular area on an HTML page. By default, a canvas has no border and no content.
     Always specify an id attribute (to be referred to in a script), and a width and height attribute to define the size of the canvas. To add a border, use the style attribute.
